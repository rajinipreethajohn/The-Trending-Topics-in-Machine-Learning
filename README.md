# The-Trending-Topics-in-Machine-Learning

##Project Overview: Use Natural Language Processing on NIPS papers to uncover the trendiest topics in machine learning research in the last 30 years.

###Project Desciption: Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) is one of the top machine learning conferences in the world where groundbreaking work is published. In this Project, I have analyzed a large collection of NIPS research papers from (1987 to 2017) to discover the latest trends in machine learning.

##Tools and techniques used: Pandas library, Natural Language Processing (NPL) from sklearn library. 

###Project tasks:
  1. Loading the NIPS papers
  2. Preparing the data for analysis
  3. Plotting how machine learning has evolved over time
  4. Preprocessing the text data
  5. A word cloud to visualize the preprocessed text data
  6. Prepare the text for LDA analysis
  7. Analysing trends with LDA
  8. The future of machine learning

###Topics covered in the Project:
  1.Data Manipulation
  2.Data Visualization
  3.Machine Learning
  4.Probability & Statistics
  5.Importing & Cleaning Data
