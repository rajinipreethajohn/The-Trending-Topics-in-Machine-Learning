# The-Trending-Topics-in-Machine-Learning

Project Desciption: Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) is one of the top machine learning conferences in the world where groundbreaking work is published. In this Project, I have analyzed a large collection of NIPS research papers from (1987 to 2017) to discover the latest trends in machine learning.

Technology: Python

Tools and techniques used: 
1.Pandas 
2.Matplotlib 
3.regular expression library 
4.wordcloud library
5.CountVectorizer & Natural Language Processing (NPL) from sklearn

Project tasks: 
*Loading the NIPS papers 
*Preparing the data for analysis 
*Plotting how machine learning has evolved over time 
*Preprocessing the text data 
*A word cloud to visualize the preprocessed text data 
*Prepare the text for Latent Dirichlet allocation- LDA analysis 
*Analysing trends with LDA *The future of machine learning

Topics: 
1.Data Manipulation 
2.Data Visualization 
3.Machine Learning 
4.Probability & Statistics 
5.Importing & Cleaning Data
